        Our team is made up of a group of students who are learning how to build websites and
        work together in a development environment. Each person on the team has a different
        strength. Some of us are more experienced with HTML and CSS, while others are new to
        coding but are really good at organizing tasks and working with others. We try to help
        each other when someone is stuck and always give feedback on what could be improved.
        We communicate through messages and check-ins, making sure we stay on track and support
        one another. Even though we're still learning, we’re starting to understand how real web
        development teams work in the professional world. Working in a group also helps us learn
        teamwork skills like collaboration, time management, and problem-solving, which are just
        as important as the coding itself.
        We also take turns leading parts of the project. For example, one team member might work
        on the layout of the home page while another adds content or styles it with CSS. This
        helps everyone get a little experience with different areas of web development. By the
        end of the project, we hope to not only finish the website but also feel more confident
        in our individual skills.

      <p>
        To build our website, we used a few different tools. The main tools we worked with
        were Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for writing our code, and GitHub for saving and sharing
        our project. VS Code is a code editor that lets us write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also
        has a lot of helpful extensions like auto-complete and error checking, which make writing
        code a little easier. We also used Git and GitHub to manage our files and track our changes.
        This is important when working on a team because it helps us avoid accidentally overwriting
        someone else's work. Git lets us commit changes with messages so we can explain what we
        changed, and GitHub keeps everything saved online. If we mess something up, we can look at
        old versions and go back if needed. Another helpful tool was the browser’s developer tools
        (DevTools), which we used to test and inspect our code. This helped us figure out if something
        wasn’t working or if a style wasn’t being applied correctly. Using these tools gave us a better
        idea of how developers work in real-life situations and how many small things go into making a
        website function properly.

        The purpose of this project was to create a simple homepage for an internal training site.
        This site introduces new team members to the tools, the people, and the goals of the project.
        It’s meant to be clear, easy to use, and informative. We used everything we’ve learned so far—
        like semantic HTML, internal links, external CSS, and more—to build a page that feels like a real
        website.
